# FastAPI-Project

## 🚀 Overview

This is a **learning project** built with FastAPI and designed as part of my journey to master modern Python web development. The goal was to build a backend-powered Todo application, practice RESTful API design, experiment with SQL databases, template engines, user authentication, and explore frontend integration.

## 🛠️ Stack & Features

- **Framework:** FastAPI
- **Templating:** Jinja2
- **Database:** MySQL (SQLAlchemy ORM)
- **Authentication:** JWT-based login/logout
- **Frontend:** Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **App Logic:** CRUD for todos (Create, Read, Update, Delete), mark as completed, user authentication and registration

## ✨ Why I Built This

I started this project to strengthen my skills with:
- FastAPI structure, routing, and dependency injection
- Working with async endpoints
- SQLAlchemy for database modeling and querying
- Implementing simple but real-world authentication
- Making endpoints secure and integrating them with a UI
- Handling forms and dynamic pages with Jinja2

The journey was about learning best practices, debugging real bugs, and developing a full-stack, database-backed Python web app from scratch.
